## Introduction

---
Our goal is to figure out the correlation between income and air pollution using data from cities across the United States.

## Data
We found data that linked city and state to income [here] (https://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/acs5?get=NAME,B19013_001E&for=place:*&in=state:*). We then found data that linked city and state to air quality [here] (https://www.epa.gov/air-trends/air-quality-cities-and-counties). We combined the two data sets into one, retaining only data points where the city and state matched.
